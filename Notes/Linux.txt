	#########################  File Structure  ###############################
	
	/ : Root directory
	
	/boot: Boot directory conatins files which are necessary for booting the server. it contains kernal file such as
	"vmlinuz-4.18.0-240.el8.x86_64" and driver image file "initramfs-4.18.0-240.el8.x86_64.img". 
	we can get same output when we run the command "uname -r".
	/boot/grub2/grub.cfg file conatins the config of this linux machine such as which version of kernal has to pick , from where OS has to load and from which image drivers has to load. All these can be decided based upon this file.
	
	/dev: All the devices which are connected to server are having a specific file in this partition. 
	
	/etc: All configuration related to server and user application will be stored under this directory.
			such are tomcat config, password files....
	
	/home: It's home directory for every user
	
	/media: if we have any media deive such as CD/DVD drive , pen drive, floppy. These all are accessable from this partiotion.
	
	/mnt: we can mount any file (NFS or any file share) to the server. we can mount any file/device which should have file system, all these can be avilable from this partiotion.
	
	/opt: It can keeps the third party application data.
	
	/tmp: Every user using linux machine have a chance to create a folder without any issue. Even other user can see the content, except deletion.
	
	/usr: This partition contains all user executables, what ever the program if it's executing by the user then corresponding file should be located /usr partition. 
			such as uname, it's a executable command. it's code is located under /usr/bin directory.
			run-->which uname
				  which git
	
	/var: the content which is keeps varies from time to time then those data can be available in this partition. such as logs, logfiles, since these files are keep updated from time to time.
	
	/proc /run /srv /sys /dev: These drives conatins data only if server is up and running. It won't maintain any persistant storage for any data.
								Also /proc can hold the live information about the system
								cat /proc/cpuinfo
								cat /proc/meminfo
								cat /proc/version

###################   Standard file Descriptors #################################
cat /etc/redhat-release > filename
cat /etc/redhat-release 1> filename
		Both notations are same. 1 represents standard output
		cat /etc/redhat-release >> /var/tmp/system_info
		ls -l /root/apple > /var/tmp/error
		   Actually no such file "apple" presents in /root dir, so it generates an error. But we redireccted it into successful output file.
		   so no info will stored under /var/tm/error file. 
		   to redirect any errors we have to mention "2>"
		 ls -l /root/apple 2> /var/tmp/error.
		 If file apple1 already existed.
		 ls -l /root/apple1 > error_file  --> Now the output will redirected to filr error_file. since apple1 is presence.
		 ls -l /root/apple3 > error_file 2>&1 ---> This will redirect both output and error.

for soft links inode number will vary from file to file. But when you create hardlink, it carries same inode number as it have from original.
Also if we remove original (source file), then no use with soft link file that we have created. 
But in hardlink it's different. when we remove original file(source file), there won't be any impact with hard link file. Because it using same inode number, content is reamins same with hard link file.

we can mount the valid formatted drive/folder to any directries. 

lsblk --> check the available mounts
df -HPT ---> can give us the exact path for each mount point.

mount /dev/sda1 /data --> now sda1 mount point is connected to dir data. Now all the content from /dev/sda1 is now avalable under /data (ls -l /data). Initially this mount is associated with /boot drive. All these files areset under /data.

we can unmount easily.

umount /data


####################   User Administration    ###########################################
VIdeo (Day2:Linux) -30 mins(6:31:27)

useradd: Adding new user
passwd: setting password for user
cat /etc/passwd

each user in linux have following properties:
	Name, password, uid, gid,home directory, bash
useradd -D ---> it gives you the default values that each user in server holds.
GROUP=100
HOME=/home
INACTIVE=-1
EXPIRE=
SHELL=/bin/bash
SKEL=/etc/skel    -->IMP
CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL=yes

Create user 'user1' and verify the values such as $HOME, $SHELL.
Also look for user entry in /etc/passwd directory.

If we wish to extract uid , gid info then we can use command 'id <user-name>'.

default SKEL for user id can get from 'useradd -D'. 
when we look into this /etc/skel directory, it contains some files (usually starts with .). These files will be reflected for all user's home directory.

[user1@centos-vm ~]$ ls -la

-rw-r--r--. 1 user1 user1 376 Jul 21  2020 .bashrc

Files .bash_logout,.bash_profile and .bashrc will be created default for all users in server. Since these files are located under /etc/skel. 
cat /etc/shadow --> This can give you the user info (user name, password, some of it's properties) will be encrypted.
cat /etc/

###################   Group Management    ############################

Keeping a kind of users in one group, so every user in on group have uniform permissions. 
Default user's group name as user name/id. It's referred as Primary Group. 

[root@centos-vm ~]# cat /etc/passwd | grep user1
user1:x:1002:1002::/home/user1:/bin/bash

Fourth field in the above line consider as group id. we can get it's name from follwing command.

[root@centos-vm ~]# cat /etc/group | grep 1002
user1:x:1002:

From above output we will come to know the associated group for id '1002' is 'user1'. 

[root@centos-vm ~]# id user1
uid=1002(user1) gid=1002(user1) groups=1002(user1)

groupadd <name of the group>
gpasswd -a <name od the user> <name of the group> --> for adding user to purticular group.
groups <name of user> --> it can list name od the groups that user is belongs to.

lslogins <username> --> this can lists useful onformation.

usermod: we can change properties of user such as Home dir, shell, primary group..
man usermod--> manual
usermod --help.

usermod -g globaladmins -G manager,hr,sysadmins -c "This is service account" -s /bin/sh user1

Above command can change it's properties such as -g : changing primary group memebership, -G: supplementary groupmenbership, -c: comments -s: changing shell.

Then run --> lslogins -u user1.  --> we cab notice the changes.

groups user1 ---> list all the groups that user belong.

userdel <username>  ---> user can delete from the server, but home directories are remains same.
userdel -r <username> ---> can delete user along with home dir as well.

Note: While deleting user from server, user account shoud be removed from all associated groups. (groups <username>, gpasswd -d <username> <groupname>).

chage -l <username> ---> This can change the password expire info. 
groupdel <group name> --> Removing group, prior to this all the users associated in this group should be removed.

######################     Networking  #####################################

ifconfig --> can get the ip info of nics
ip a ---> it can let us know the status of connected nics, along with ip info.
route -n --> for which gateway the traffic has been routed.
ethtool <nic-name>: Here we have to notice the spped, duplex, Link Detected fields.

cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s3  ---> From here we can change the configuration of nic such as Static, gateway, 


#############   Permissions  #########################

PATH=$PATH:/data
echo $PATH
Same we can do it by editing the 

chmod 777 file1 ---> it can grant full control(Read,Write and Execute) for file1 for owner,group,others.

R-4
W-2
X-1.

chmod 755 file2. 
ls -l file2
Only root can the permissions for all files.

chmod u+rwx,g+rx,o+rx file1
chmod o-rx file1


Execute permission is required for Directories, shell/bash scripts, for any binaries. if we not grant the execute permission for these then that file can't be executed. 

chown  <username> <file name>

chown -R <username>:<groupname> <folder name>  ----> Change the permissions recurssively for all files reside the folder.

chown  <username>:<groupname> <file name> ----> to change the ownership for a file, 

set uid---> append digit 4 while assigning the permissions for a file

chmod 4755 file1 
chmod u+s file1
chmod 0755 file1
chmod u-s file1

set gid --->group ownership can effect with this 

stickybit permission----> any one can write the data they want, but deletion can be done only by the owner of the file/dir

chmod 1777 dir1 ---> should give full permission for all. with this even though granted full control for other users. still they can't delete the files due to this feature.
we can use this for most of tmp directories. 

chmod +t <dir-name> 
chmod -t <dir-name>

[root@centos-vm /]# ls -ld /tmp/
drwxrwxrwt. 13 root root 242 Nov 23 10:16 /tmp/
[root@centos-vm /]# ls -ld /var/tmp/
drwxrwxrwt. 5 root root 144 Nov 23 09:22 /var/tmp/


Here we can notice the 't' on permissions tab.

umask: for root it's 0022 for other users it is 0002. 

root: file permissions: 666-644=022
	  directory permissions: 777-755=022
other users: file-> 666-664=002
			 dir --> 777-775=002


Giving sudo permissions for user----> gpasswd -a <username> wheel
After adding user to group 'wheel' user will get sudo permissions. 

check it by--> grep wheel /etc/group
			   id <user-name> 
we can perform same from the following file:

			vi /etc/sudoers ---> edit the file by entering user names in listed groups such as root,sys,wheel....
